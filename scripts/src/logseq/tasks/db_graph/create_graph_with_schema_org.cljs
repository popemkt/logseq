  "Script that converts the jsonld version of schema.org into Logseq classes and
  properties. Initially works with 900 classes and 1368 properties! The script
   currently provides the following in a Logseq graph:
   * All schema.org classes with their name, url, parent class (namespace) and properties
     * Some classes are renamed due to naming conflicts
   * All properties with their property type, url, description
     * Property type is determined by looking for the first range value that is
       a subclass of https://schema.org/DataType and then falling back to :page.
     * Some properties are skipped because they are superseded/deprecated or because they have a property
       type logseq doesnt' support yet
     * schema.org assumes no cardinality. For now, only :page properties are given a :cardinality :many"
